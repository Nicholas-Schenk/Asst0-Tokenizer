# Asst0-Tokenizer
Developed with https://github.com/rajdesai925/

This tokenizer program works by taking in a single string within double quotation marks through the command line. This string is taken by the program and tokenized recursively. The first character of the input string is read to determine whether the token is a word, number, or operator. Once the type of token is determined, the input string is parsed to find and output the token. The program then recursively moves on to the next token, by once again checking the first character. Token creation is greedy, meaning tokens are not terminated until a character that cannot be part of the token is reached.

The program can successfuly tokenize words, decimal integers, octal integers, hexadecimal integers, decimal floating-points, and C operators. It can also tokenize C keywords such as if, else, while, etc. Both single line comments, which can be terminated with '\n', and block style comments are also supported. Strings surrounded with single quotation marks are also recognized by this tokenizer when the input string is surrounded by double quotes. Conversely when the input string is surrounded by single quotes it can recognize strings within it surrounded by double quotaition marks.
